This project was created for the purposes of the Integrify Academy pre-assignment using React.

Using React functional components, it calls the API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and displays each user's information on the homepage as a set of cards.

Each card may be clicked on to view further details of the user, using the React Router's Route and useParams functionalities to redirect the user to a new page within the app in which the url contains the specific user's ID.

The API is then called with the specific user's ID and its detailed information is displayed. 

The project uses useState and useEffect to dynamically render the API's response as it is received.
